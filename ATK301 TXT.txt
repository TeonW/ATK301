This is for ATK301. 
My name is Teon Whitt. I'm very interested into music and love playing basketball. For my profession I want to be in the music industry,
as a child I've always loved music all music. Anita Baker is one of my top favorite artists always will be. When I get older I would
like to have a AAU basketball team with one of my close friends as the head coach. I love cars too SRT8 Jeep is my favorite car of all
time. I would take that car over any vehicle any day of the week. Also, I love tattoo I like the pain that's behind it and also like the
meaning of a tattoo when I get one.
