  <p> I'm a Junior at ISU, taking up Arts & Technology. I want to go into the music industry one day. As a of right now though,
    I just design covers and collages for people. I want to do as much as possible pertaining to the industry no matter what it
    is, I learned that you can't focus on one of thing if you want to be in the music industry because you might miss out on an oppurtunity.
    I'm glad I have Arts & Technology as a major, it steady enhances my skills in differet areas where I can use in real world to create something
    and leave it behind. I like playing the game Modern Warfare, 2K, Fortnite, & UFC. I'm a member of Kappa Alpha Charter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fratenity, Inc.
    and one of my favorite meals to make is Salmon, Asparagus, Loaded Mashed Potatoes and Salad. </P>
